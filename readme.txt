## Using the "[pdf]" shortcode
[pdf]...[/pdf] (Between the tags, you'll provide the URL for the PDF to embed.)  
The '[pdf]' shorttag accepts several optional parameters:
  - 'width' - sets the width of the frame the PDF is embedded in. By default, this is set to 100%.
  - 'height' - sets the height of the frame the PDF is embedded in. By default, this is unset.
  - 'title' - sets the title of the PDF, for use in the fallback link text.

## Examples:
Short URL: [pdf]http://localhost/PDF_URL[/pdf]
Advance URL: [pdf width=\"200px\" height=\"400px\" title=\"title1\"]http://localhost/PDF_URL[/pdf]
